# Bird-Identification-using-ResNet50
Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset has large number of categories make it more interesting . With the help of Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 I train a ResNet 50 Model using transfer learning and save that model in a HDF5 file and convert it into tflite file and with the help of tflite file I develop a android application that can predict bird category with the probability and with the help of this mobile application we can easily find out the category of the dead bird (bird strike with aircraft) so that we can easily get the information of the bird that which category birds can crash aircraft engine so that next time we can reduce the damage at the time of bird strike.
